# Bellman-Ford-Routing-Algorithm
Bellman Ford Routing Algorithm in Computer Networks which is used to find the shortest path of each node to all the other nodes in the topology. All node's configuration files are passed as arguments. Algorithm is implemented in python

Configurations Files of nodes are passed as an argument of each node starting and then node's class is initialized with the configuration files and then routing table is made and passed to bellman ford alogrirthm and then display function is used to display the updates shortest distances of each node.
